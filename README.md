### Run command 
- sudo docker build -t foo . && sudo docker run foo 
- Run this from the project root location where Dockerfile exists

### Access
- After this is complete, we can access the app via browser using the url outputted.  
- For now the External URL won't be available with this config, but that would be available if we run it without Docker.

### TODO
- Expose this over internet
